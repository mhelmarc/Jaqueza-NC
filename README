This is Nouveau-PRU port of Remora (https://github.com/scottalford75/Remora)
a free, opensource LinuxCNC component and Programmable Realtime Unit (PRU)
to stm32f4 (STM32F407vg to be exact that's what I have).

TODO:
	Hardware PWM
	Encoder input (MPG, servo)
 
Library used is https://github.com/andysworkshop/stm32plus with a few mods.
Unfortunately the library supported a limited series of STM32F4 microcontrollers
due to an older stdperipheral library used.

***This is an Eclipse project with GCC-Arm plugins (not STM32CUBE)

If building with GCC >= 9.x, the temporary workaround can be found
here https://github.com/andysworkshop/stm32plus/issues/224

keep having fun, and don't forget to share :-)
